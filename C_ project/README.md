## Introduction
This project showcases various C programs written to demonstrate core concepts in computer engineering. Each program is well-documented and includes comments to help understand the code's logic and purpose.

## Programs

### Array Manipulation
This program demonstrates basic operations on arrays, such as:
- **Create**: Initialize an array with user-defined elements.
- **Insert**: Add an element at a specific position in the array.
- **Delete**: Remove an element from the array.
- **Display**: Show the elements of the array.

You can find the program under `array_manipulation.c` in the repository.

### Binary Search Algorithm
A classic implementation of the binary search algorithm with improvements to handle edge cases. The program efficiently finds the position of an element in a sorted array.

You can find the program under `binary_search.c` in the repository.

### Other Programs
Additional C programs may include:
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of various sorting techniques.
- **Linked Lists**: Basic operations on linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation of stack and queue data structures.

Please explore the repository for more examples.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pras7616533/Academic_Project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the C project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Academic_Project/C_project
    ```
3. Compile the program using GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc array_manipulation.c -o array_manipulation
    ```
4. Run the compiled program:
    ```bash
    ./array_manipulation
    ```

Repeat the above steps for any other programs you wish to run.

## Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:
