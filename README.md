## Introduction
This repository is a compilation of my academic work, including code, documentation, and projects. The primary focus is on developing strong problem-solving skills using various programming languages, with an emphasis on C programming.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on different programming languages and types of projects. Below is an overview of the structure:

## Projects and Programs

### C Programming
The `C_project` directory contains various C programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts and algorithms, such as:
- **Array Manipulation**: Functions to create, insert, delete, and display elements in an array.
- **Binary Search**: An optimized binary search algorithm for finding elements in a sorted array.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of different sorting techniques (e.g., bubble sort, quick sort).
- **Linked Lists**: Basic operations on singly and doubly linked lists.

Each program is accompanied by a `README.md` file explaining its purpose, usage, and any important details.

### Other Programming Languages
In addition to C programming, the repository may also contain projects in other languages such as Python and Java. These are organized in their respective folders and include:
- **Python**: Scripts demonstrating data manipulation, file handling, and basic algorithms.
- **Java**: Programs illustrating object-oriented programming concepts.

Explore each directory to find detailed information about the specific projects.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pras7616533/Academic_Project.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the desired project**:
    ```bash
    cd Academic_Project/C_project
    ```
3. **Compile and Run** (for C programs):
    ```bash
    gcc array_manipulation.c -o array_manipulation
    ./array_manipulation
    ```

   Instructions for other programming languages will be provided in their respective `README.md` files.
